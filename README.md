# FoodDeliverySystems

Abstract
------------------
The food delivery market prospers recently due to the COVID-19. 
The demands for high-quality food delivery service encourage food delivery companies to hire more vehicles and drivers. 
However, how to assign orders to different drivers that maximize rewards remains a non-trivial challenge. 
In this project, we model the food delivery problem under the paradigm of reinforcement learning and solve it with advantages actor-critic as well as policy gradient. 
We compare the performance of two different methods to obtain the advantage estimations and demonstrate some interesting insights of the order assignment strategy.
